# Claude Code Instructions

All coding instructions are in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Read that file before making any changes.

**Never add rules to this file unless explicitly instructed.**

## Claude Code Workflow

When assigned a GitHub issue (user pastes an issue URL or says "work on issue #N"), ALWAYS enter plan mode first (use EnterPlanMode) before writing any code. Follow the 5-phase planning workflow: explore codebase, design approach, confirm with user, then implement.
